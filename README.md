# bearbeta

**Description**:  it is common prcatice for companies to use resume scanners to screen out candidates from their employement processes. 
Those scanners are often pay to play. 
Building an open source scanner to give tips to applicants is one small attempt at leveling the field of play so everyone can have a fair assessment. 

Other things to include:

  - **Technology stack**: still calculating, but I'm thinking heavy in python, and then hosting it with lamda functions. 
  - **Status**: WAY Before beta. 


## Dependencies

YES, TBD

## Installation

lololol not quite yet. 


## Usage

Usage would hopefully look like, give your resume destination, give your job posting file destination, and then wait for output. 

## How to test the software

run smoketest.py from the base dir. 

## Known issues

known issues right now stem from existence (and lack thereof)
